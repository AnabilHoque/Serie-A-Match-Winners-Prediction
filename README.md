# Building a Machine Learning Model to predict match winners in Seria A
* Part 1 - serieAScraping: We extract Serie A data from [FBREF](https://fbref.com/en/), process it and store it locally in a CSV file. Note we only extract data for 3 seasons. We will scrape more seasons later on.
* Part 2 - seriaAPrediction: We build a Machine Learning Model that predicts match winners in Seria A.
